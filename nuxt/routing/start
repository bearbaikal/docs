Nuxt generates dinamic routes structure from file system, it's called "File system routing" in NUXT.
The main thing I should understand is nuxt takes file system structure and generate ~/.nuxt/routes.json
from it. That's all!

Other part of routing is how nuxt-link generates links!
To specify route params with nuxt-link I should use params property of nuxt-link "to" attribute.
